# Interactive Refraction Effect

An interactive visual art project that creates a mesmerizing refraction effect using particles that respond to mouse movement, audio input, and dynamic wave patterns. Built with p5.js, this project combines fluid animation with audio reactivity to create an engaging visual experience.

## Features

- Interactive particle system that responds to mouse movement
- Audio reactivity with microphone input
- Dynamic wave patterns that create flowing movements
- Bloom effect for enhanced visual appeal
- Explosion effects on mouse clicks
- Color shifting and particle glow effects

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Move your mouse across the screen to interact with particles
3. Click and hold to create explosion effects
4. Use the audio controls to:
   - Enable/disable audio reactivity
   - Adjust audio sensitivity using the slider

## Controls

- **Mouse Movement**: Influences particle movement and creates glowing effects
- **Mouse Click**: Creates explosion effects that ripple through the particle field
- **Audio Toggle**: Enable/disable microphone input for audio reactive effects
- **Sensitivity Slider**: Adjust how responsive the particles are to audio input

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Microphone access (optional, for audio reactivity)
- JavaScript enabled

## Dependencies

- p5.js (v1.9.0)
- p5.sound.js (v1.9.0)
